## What you should know about the project

The project is a simple backendless dashboard, used to showcase Next.js and React knowledge and mastery,
this projects mocks server requests by setTimeout calls and loaders.
Authorization is also mocked for clarity, initially you need to register by clicking "Join the waitlist", then finish the onboarding process,
then you should be redirected to dashboard (clean page) with "Logout" button, after you logout you can login from your previous credentials,
but if you decide to use registration again, it'll overwrite the previous credentials so you can't login from those credentials anymore, only from new ones. (It's not a bug, it's done only for clarity purposes)
